# Blockchain-in-a-Box

A batteries-included ethereum blockchain for bootstrapping the Metaverse. ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

Includes contracts for identity, inventory, currency and trade. Can be extended for any kind of marketplace application, but the goal is fast, free interoperable transfer of all user data from one server-authoratative platform to another. The ideal use case we imagine is a portal between two separate virtual worlds, sharing user data over the blockchain.

## What Is This?
A Node.js-based REST API, Ethereum node, cache service and smart contracts to deploy your own Ethereum-based sidechain for identity and durable assets. Users can transfer assets created on your platform to the Ethereum or Polygon main networks.

## Who Is It For?
1. Javascript developers who want to build interoperable applications with durable digital assets but don't have the resources to write everything from scratch and need a starting point which they can mold to their needs.

2. Developers interested in creating metaverse-scale interoperable applications where users may want to move their assets and identity to other platforms.

3. Developers of existing applications who cannot reasonably remove their database from their application and want to mirror this data onto blockchain or vice versa.

4. Organizations who wish to build blockchains with other organizations and need a standard and conventional way to do so.

Full GUI managment of a Custodial SideChain

What are sidechains? They are either:

1. Custodial - assets are moved to a parallel chain with its own consensus mechanism & security.

2. Non-custodial - assets are held & state is secured by smart contracts on Ethereum (= can survive an attack of the sidechain).

# where can I find the code?
Everything is in the packages folder. You shouldn't need to change much, beyond setup.

## packages/api
The API is what you'll interact with. Generate wallets, mint tokens, etc.
Additional documentation [here](./packages/api/README.md)

## packages/cache
The cache server listens to the chain for events and posts them to Redis/Elasticache
Additional documentation [here](./packages/cache/README.md)

## packages/ethereum
Ethereum, EthStats, Remix IDE and all related services as Docker/Kubernetes YAML files
Additional documentation [here](./packages/ethereum/README.md)

## packages/market
A marketplace for your blockchain
Additional documentation [here](./packages/market/README.md)

## packages/market-service
Backend services for the marketplace
Additional documentation [here](./packages/market/README.md)

## packages/terraform-eks
Simple deployment to Amazon EKS using Terraform
Additional documentation [here](./packages/ethereum/README.md)

# Setup and Installation

## Configure .env file
In the root folder create a clone of `.env.default` file and name it `.env`. Update the content of `.env` file with your resources. 

## Setup Pinata Account
Pinata is allows you to upload and manage files on IPFS. It provides IPFS API through which you can easily perform IPFS pinning service.

1. Open https://pinata.cloud/ and sigup/login.
2. Navigate to https://pinata.cloud/keys and create a new key. Make sure to check Admin key switch button in the modal.
3. Update `.env` file with following entries from generated key.
    ```
    PINATA_API_KEY=
    PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY=
    ```

# Deployment

## Local deployment
Local deployment can be done using Kubectl and Minikube. Full instructions are [here](./packages/ethereum/README.md)

## Deployment to AWS
AWS setup and deployment is done via Terraform, but there are also instructions on deploying directly to EKS [here](./packages/ethereum/README.md) and [here](./packages/terraform-eks/README.md)

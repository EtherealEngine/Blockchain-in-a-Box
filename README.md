# Blockchain-in-a-Box
A batteries-included ethereum blockchain for bootstrapping the Metaverse.ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

## What Is This?
A Node.js-based REST API, Ethereum node, cache service and smart contracts to deploy your own Ethereum-based sidechain and tokenize your assets. Users can transfer tokens minted on your platform to the Ethereum or Polygon main networks.

## Who Is It For?
1. Javascript developers who want to build interoperable applications with tokenized assets but don't have the resources to write everything from scratch and need a starting point which they can mold to their needs.

2. Developers interested in creating metaverse-scale interoperable applications where users may want to move their assets and identity to other platforms.

3. Developers of existing applications who cannot reasonably remove their database from their application and want to mirror this data onto blockchain or vice versa.

4. Organizations who wish to build blockchains with other organizations and need a standard and conventional way to do so.

## Who Made It?
A lot of the core contract and web3 code was  written by Avaer Kazmer and the Webaverse team. If you are interested in participating in an ambitious 3D universe built on blockchain technology, check out https://webaverse.com/

Webaverse provides some ready-made tools for users to integrate blockchain into their communities and to start making and trading assets on their Discord or other social platform. However, while Webaverse is an open source project, they do not have the resources to support external developer projects right now.

This package was created by the architects at XRFoundation to make a simple, streamlined and developer friendly system for interacting with their own blockchain, with the goal that these chains can be connected to each other or to Webaverse itself.
